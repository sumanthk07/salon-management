            <p>The following material document the design and development of a database application to
                support a small salon. The project begins with description as to how our model eclipse the cons
                of existing system and proceeds through conceptual ER diagram, logical Relational Schema
                model and finally implementation of the database application.</p>
            <p>Many Salon have been using spreadsheets and paper log book to keep track of
                customers, appointments and payments. We would like to replace this manual method of
                tracking the business with a database.</p>
            <p>In our business, Customer make Appointments with their favorite stylist or other
                employee and can indulge in a number of Services such basic haircut, hair styling, hair coloring,
                perm, facial, manicure, pedicure, etc. We need to keep track of materials (Shampoo, Hair color
                etc.) and the time it will take to complete each service. While each service has a standard price,
                promotions and other may affect the actual price extended to the customer for the given
                services.</p>
            <p>We also need to keep track of Billing for each customer, to track the business profit and
                loss.</p>
            <p>We also keep track of our employees including their home address, contact information
                and salary. We also keep track of each customerâ€™s contact information as well as other basic
                information like gender, payment history etc.</p>
